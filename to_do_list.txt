## 📋 TODO List

### 🟦 Phase 1 — Foundation

- [X] Implement full `environment.py`
- [X] Implement occupancy grid inflate & coordinate transforms
- [X] Define UAV state structure in `simulation.py`

### 🟩 Phase 2 — Potential Field Planner

- [X] Attractive potential toward goal
- [X] Repulsive potential from obstacles
- [X] Repulsive potential between UAVs
- [X] Clamp force magnitude and gradients
- [X] Integrate planner into `simulation.py`

### 🟧 Phase 3 — Controller & Kinematics

- [X] Convert PF vector → steering & velocity
- [X] Implement bicycle model
- [X] Add heading stabilization

### 🟪 Phase 4 — GUI System

- [ ] Build PySide6 main window
- [ ] Integrate Matplotlib canvas
- [ ] Implement buttons and their callbacks
- [ ] Click-to-paint obstacles
- [ ] Add planner selection (PF only for now)

### 🟥 Phase 5 — Visualization

- [ ] Draw map, obstacles, UAVs, paths
- [ ] Smooth real-time updates
- [ ] Goal & field vector visualization (optional)

### 🟫 Phase 6 — Testing & Polishing

- [ ] Test PF convergence on simple maps
- [ ] Validate obstacle avoidance
- [ ] Multi-UAV interaction testing
- [ ] Add logging & diagnostics
